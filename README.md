Description About The Problem
Title: Minimum Operations to Reach at Least K

Description:
This C++ solution finds the minimum number of operations required to ensure that the smallest element in the array is at least K. The approach involves:

Sorting the array to process elements in increasing order.
Using a priority queue-like merging technique with an auxiliary vector to generate new elements.
Repeatedly selecting the two smallest values, applying the formula 2 * x + y, and inserting the result back until the smallest element reaches K.
This ensures an optimal and efficient approach to solving the problem. ðŸš€
